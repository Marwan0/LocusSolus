# LocusSolus
Locus Solus is an interactive VR installation featured at CSW Warsaw in early 2018.
It contains recorded point clouds of people that were captured during the exhibition in the following process:

1. person was asked to see the experience
2. the same person was asked if he wants to extend the exhibition with his performance
3. If yes, then after recording point cloud data was included in running installation.
4. The process was repeated during the whole show.

The program includes couple of interesting coding techniques:

- Unity native Windows C++ plugin for fast loading and preprocessing of cloud data
- marching cubes renderer on GPU
- Indirect drawing methods

Feel free to use and modify the experience.
